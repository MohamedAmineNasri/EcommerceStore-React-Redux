# EcommerceStore-React-Redux

**EcommerceStore-React-Redux** is a practice project aimed at mastering Redux state management within a React application. The project uses the **Fake Store API** to provide realistic e-commerce data, including products, categories, and more.

## Features

- **Product Listing Page**: Displays a list of products fetched dynamically from the Fake Store API.
- **Product Detail Page**: Shows detailed information about a selected product, including its description, price, and category.
- **Redux State Management**: Utilizes `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks to manage state and trigger actions effectively.
- **Routing**: Implements React Router to enable smooth navigation between pages.
- **Action Types**: Includes select and remove action types to manage product interactions.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with Redux by building a functional e-commerce application. It serves as a foundation for understanding how to manage complex application state in a scalable and efficient manner.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Redux**: For managing application state.
- **React Router**: For routing between different pages.
- **Fake Store API**: For fetching product data.
